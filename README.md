Features
Strong encryption: Utilizes AES-256 (can be modified to AES-128) encryption for maximum security.
Customizable parameters: Easily configure encryption mode, padding, and key size.
Easy-to-use API: Provides simple methods for encryption and decryption.
Cross-platform compatibility: Can be used in both Node.js and browser environments.

Usage
Here's how you can use the library in your JavaScript application:
Just Uncomment the encryptMessage/decryptMessage function call and modify the values of "txtToEncrypt" , "txtToDecrypt" and "passphrase" as per requirement and then save the file.

To get the encrypted/decrypted message on console execute the encryptor file using the following command:
